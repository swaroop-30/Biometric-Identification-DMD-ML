# Biometric-Identification-DMD-ML
This repository demonstrates my work on ECG based biometric identification system using dynamic mode decomposition and machine learning

Biometrics hold significant importance across diverse domains today, notably in areas such as finance and identification. Depending on systems vulnerable to spoofing, impersonation, and covert attacks entails substantial risks. Our focus has shifted towards investigating the viability of utilizing ECG signals for authentication, owing to their inherent characteristics that render replication by another individual exceedingly difficult. The principal objective is to create biometric systems that capitalize on ECG signals for dependable authentication. The proposed methodology has attained an identification accuracy of 99.4% for the MIT-BIH Normal Sinus Rhythm (NSR) database.
